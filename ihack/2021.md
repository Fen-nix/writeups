# iHack 2021 Classic CTF

**Team: Ministry of Penetration**

## Challenge: The Onion Things

This challenge is a series with eight challenges.  Challenges 1 through 7 use the same binary "firmware" file that you must extract data from in order to answer the questions.

In the real world this is something I've done quite a bit of in research on IoT devices, so I'm fairly familiar with most of the process and some of the gotchas.

### 1 - Firmware Analysis Things 1/3 (75pts)
```
Hi, Iâ€™m Miu and I am happy to share with you my very first track as a Hackfest CTF designer member.

The firmware below is meant to run on an embedded system as big as a cherry ! Its comes with multiple services and has enough flexibility to enable makers of all skill levels to build all kind of IoT projects.

Letâ€™s jump together into the IoT World!

Download the binary and find your way to the filesystem and to the Things ;] .

ATTENTION : You will need this firmware to do the challenges 1 to 7 of this track !
```

The objective here is to obtain what I assume will be an obvious flag from within the firmware.

To start with, the simplest thing is always `binwalk`, which has a handy automatic extraction feature (`-e`):

```
[fennix@host ihack][0]
$ binwalk -e the-onion-thing.bin 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x34756B90, created: 2020-07-14 21:51:14, image size: 1614170 bytes, Data Address: 0x80000000, Entry Point: 0x80000000, data CRC: 0xCF6EDD01, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: lzma, image name: "MIPS OpenWrt Linux-4.14.81"
64            0x40            LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x6D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: 5111620 bytes
1614234       0x18A19A        Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:xz, size: 8003064 bytes, 2144 inodes, blocksize: 262144 bytes, created: 2021-06-18 06:54:13
```

This unpacks the files within automatically for us into a directory:
```
[fennix@host ihack][0]
$ ls 
the-onion-thing.bin  _the-onion-thing.bin.extracted
```

Within this directory there's several files but we only really care about the root filesystem for the device in this case (`squashfs-root`).

In the root of the firmware there's a file called `welcome` which contains our flag:
```

### 2 - Firmware Analysis Things 2/3 (75pts)

```
While performing firmware analysis, every information we find can be useful to achieve our goal. Build the flag using the following informations :

>>  Firmware's hostname
>>  CPU architecture
>>  GNU/Linux distribution
>>  The System-on-a-Chip's (SoC) Brand Name

How it should look : HF-HostnameArchDistribSocbrandName (case insensitive)
```

This begins our in-firmware recon.

While the hostname is listed first a lot of times it's best to start with which distribution you're working on as that will inform a lot of your further checks, especially once you get familiar with different distributions.

Astute readers will notice we had some information from binwalk earlier that disclosed a couple of things:
```
0             0x0             uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x34756B90, created: 2020-07-14 21:51:14, image size: 1614170 bytes, Data Address: 0x80000000, Entry Point: 0x80000000, data CRC: 0xCF6EDD01, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: lzma, image name: "MIPS OpenWrt Linux-4.14.81"
```

This is good but not always perfect so it's important to confirm by looking at the actual firmware itself.

Most Linux distributions have a file symlinked to `/etc/os-release` that contains the distribution release information, and our firmware is no exception:
```
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ cat etc/os-release
NAME="OpenWrt"
VERSION="18.06-SNAPSHOT"
ID="openwrt"
ID_LIKE="lede openwrt"
PRETTY_NAME="OpenWrt 18.06-SNAPSHOT"
VERSION_ID="18.06-snapshot"
HOME_URL="http://openwrt.org/"
BUG_URL="http://bugs.openwrt.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://forum.lede-project.org/"
BUILD_ID="r0+7475-e6757b4765"
LEDE_BOARD="ramips/mt76x8"
LEDE_ARCH="mipsel_24kc"
LEDE_TAINTS="no-all busybox"
LEDE_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER="OpenWrt"
LEDE_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER_URL="http://openwrt.org/"
LEDE_DEVICE_PRODUCT="Generic"
LEDE_DEVICE_REVISION="v0"
LEDE_RELEASE="OpenWrt 18.06-SNAPSHOT r0+7475-e6757b4765"
```

Right away this gives us some of what we're looking for:
- NAME tells us it's OpenWrt
- LEDE_ARCH tells us it's MIPSEL/MIPS
- LEDE_BOARD tells us the specific board we're looking for.
- Sometimes the BUILD_ID can also be put to use to find the specific board.

Having already worked with OpenWrt a few times in the past, I'm familiar enough with it to know that most of the time its system configuration goes into `/etc/config/` and specifically the files `/etc/config/system` and `/etc/config/network` would probably list the hostname.

Sure enough, looking at the `system` file shows us the hostname (trimmed for brevity):
```
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ cat etc/config/system
config system
        option hostname 'OnionOmega2'
        option timezone 'UTC'
        option timezone 'GMT0'
        option ttylogin '0'
        option log_size '64'
        option urandom_seed '0'
        option cronloglevel '8'

config timeserver 'ntp'
        [...]
```

This agrees with `/etc/config/network`:
```
config interface 'wwan'
        option ifname 'apcli0'
        option proto 'dhcp'
        option hostname 'OnionOmega2'
```

So now we have 3/4 of what we're looking for: 
- Hostname
- Architecture
- Distribution

We just need to determine the board.  A quick google for the `ramips/mt76x8` identified in the `os-release` file showed a bunch of possibilities, and that didn't help narrow anything down for me.  

A search on the BUILD_ID yielded [precisely one thread](https://community.onion.io/topic/4231/many-errors-with-omega2-opkg-segfaults-unable-to-upgrade-firmware/12) that suggested it was an Onion Omega2 device, which matches our hostname.  I'd never heard of this particular device before so that part wasn't obvious.

What we need here is the name for the SoC itself though, so I dug up the [Onion Omega2 product page](https://onion.io/Omega2/) and saw that the specifications say it's an **MT7688AN** chipset.  Given the name, it's likely MediaTek, which a quick check confirmed.

Putting these all together the flag was either
`HF-OnionOmega2mipsOpenWrtMediaTek` or `HF-OnionOmega2mipselOpenWrtMediaTek`.

From memory it was the former (I forgot to record which ðŸ˜…).

### 3 - Firmware Analysis Things 3/3 (75pts)

```
One of the common vulnerabilities in IoT Devices is the use of default passwords which unfortunately might be unchanged...

You don't need HF- , iHack- or anything for the flag, only the information you gathered ;]
```

This was obviously just trying to identify the existing default password of the device.

Some quick research showed that there were several default passwords for the device but the default **root** password for the device was `onioneer` according to the [first time setup guide](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html).

This was the flag, however there is an easy way to confirm the root password is unchanged by looking at the `etc/shadow` file from the firmware.

Here's the line for root:
```
root:$1$KQPytDqQ$VeSk71/tZtfEQimevzUOA0:16676:0:99999:7:::
```

In order to reproduce this, we just need an equivalent command via `mkpasswd`.

The breakout of the password command is:
- $1 = Mode, in this case MD5
- $KQPytDqQ = The salt value
- $VeSk71/tZtfEQimevzUOA0 = The hashed password value
- :16676 = The number of rounds of hashing

To confirm this is the password, the command is just:
```
[fennix@host etc][0]
$ mkpasswd -5 -R 16676 -S KQPytDqQ onioneer
$1$KQPytDqQ$VeSk71/tZtfEQimevzUOA0
```

Note that we get the identical output for the password field.

### 4 - Wallet Things 1/2 (100pts)

```
It seems that very valuable things are hidden somewhere in the filesystem, the first one could be used to import or export secrets !
```

In this challenge, we needed to look for something valuable.  One of the things I happened to notice on a previous scan of directories was the existence of `/etc/secret` within the firmware, modified very recently:
```
[fennix@host etc][0]
$ ls -latr | tail -n 10
-rw-r--r--  1 fennix fennix  405 Jul 14  2020 banner
drwxr-xr-x  3 fennix fennix 4096 Jul 14  2020 avahi
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix    7 Jun 18 01:37 TZ -> /tmp/TZ
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix   16 Jun 18 01:37 resolv.conf -> /tmp/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix   21 Jun 18 01:37 os-release -> ../usr/lib/os-release
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix   12 Jun 18 01:37 mtab -> /proc/mounts
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix   14 Jun 18 01:37 localtime -> /tmp/localtime
drwxr-xr-x 16 fennix fennix 4096 Jun 18 02:39 ..
drwxr-xr-x 22 fennix fennix 4096 Jun 18 02:44 .
drwxr-xr-x  2 fennix fennix 4096 Jun 18 02:48 secret

```

Within this `secret` directory was a file named `valuable-thing.bin` which contained:
```
00110111 00110111 01001010 00110101 01011010 01101111 01100101 00110010 01110010 01101101 00110110 01110011 01010110 01111010 00110010 00110111 01101110 01100011 01101111 00111001 01010011 01010000 01111000 01001011 01100011 01110000 01100100 01110011 01001110 01011000 01100101 01010110 00110110 01001010 00110011 01110010 01101110 01101011 01010110 01110000 01110100 01101101 01101111 01110110 01110101 01110010 01000100 00110010 00000000 00110100 01001101 01101000
```

Obviously this is binary, so over to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) we go.

Placing the content into input and then adding a recipe of **From Binary** with the defaults seemed to do the trick: 
`77J5Zoe2rm6sVz27nco9SPxKcpdsNXeV6J3rnkVptmovurD2.4Mh`

Unfortunately, this wasn't the flag.  I ran this by my team and felt foolish when one of them pointed out that endianness was probably different on MIPS vs Intel.  Sure enough if you add in a recipe of **Swap Endianness** with Data Format = Raw you get a different (and correct) result:
`5J772eoZs6mr72zV9ocnKxPSsdpcVeXNr3J6pVknvomt2DruhM4.`

The last byte (rendered as `.`) is actually a null byte in the data.  Omitting that was all that was necessary and we had the flag.

### 7 - You shall experience my adventure ! (200pts)

```
Given the architecture of the device, this binary can't be executed on your machine. Well.. That's actually not true ! There is a way : Emulation.

Let's use all the informations we gathered so far and find a way to do so.
```

This part I have a bit of experience with.  The answer to these sorts of things is usually `qemu` and there's a ton of different architectures supported.

Depending on what distribution you're using the package name will change or may not exist but ultimately what you want is the `qemu-user-static` package.  This package contains statically-compiled versions of the qemu applications and will allow you to run programs from other architectures on your system.

But first we have to find the file.

I started down the usual path of culprits, doing a find where things were executable and modified after 200 days ago, figuring that was a good cutoff, but this yielded nothing.

Here's what that looks like anyways:
```
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ find . -type f -perm -500 -mtime -200 -exec ls -l {} \;
-rwxr--r-- 1 fennix fennix 479 Jun 18 02:50 ./root/wallet.zip
```

That didn't make sense as the zip file seemed to be for another challenge (Wallet 2/2).  I started poking around using my "5 newest changes" ls in the various bin directories:
```
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ ls -latr usr/local/bin/ | tail -n 5
ls: cannot access 'usr/local/bin/': No such file or directory
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ ls -latr usr/bin/ | tail -n 5
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fennix fennix     17 Jun 18 01:37 bunzip2 -> ../../bin/busybox
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fennix fennix     17 Jun 18 01:37 basename -> ../../bin/busybox
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fennix fennix     17 Jun 18 01:37 awk -> ../../bin/busybox
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fennix fennix     17 Jun 18 01:37 [[ -> ../../bin/busybox
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fennix fennix     17 Jun 18 01:37 [ -> ../../bin/busybox
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ ls -latr bin/ | tail -n 5
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix     19 Jun 18 01:37 base64 -> /usr/bin/gnu-base64
lrwxrwxrwx  1 fennix fennix      7 Jun 18 01:37 ash -> busybox
drwxr-xr-x 16 fennix fennix   4096 Jun 18 02:39 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 fennix fennix   9684 Jun 18 02:41 flag
drwxr-xr-x  2 fennix fennix   4096 Jun 18 02:46 .
```

Bingo, `flag` looks interesting and isn't executable.

In order to execute this with `qemu`, you need to copy the static version of the binary into the squashfs_root, then chroot into it and run it, then run the binary you're interested in.

Here's how that part works, including the mistakes I made on the first pass, such as forgetting that chroot requires sudo, and that the file needs to be executable to run it this way:
```
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ cp /usr/bin/qemu-mipsel-static ./
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ chroot . ./qemu-mipsel-static ./bin/flag
chroot: cannot change root directory to '.': Operation not permitted
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ sudo chroot . ./qemu-mipsel-static ./bin/flag
[sudo] password for fennix: 
Error while loading ./bin/flag: Permission denied
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ chmod +x ./bin/flag
[fennix@host squashfs-root][0]
$ sudo chroot . ./qemu-mipsel-static ./bin/flag
The Flag is: HF-EmulationIsFun
```

There we have the flag!

## Summary

I found these challenges fun and a good refresher on dissecting firmware.  I wasn't able to get Wallet 2/2 but I suspect it would require writing a simple script to unzip things.  Unfortunately I couldn't dedicate the full amount of time to the CTF.
